Code for generating zoom renders of the mandelbrot set, and storing them as gifs.
Examples folder contains a B/W zoom, a still image and a colour zoom with some gradient for generating.
In the code folder, the colourless gif generation will work without pre-requisites. However, for colour plots, a colour pallete must first be generated.
